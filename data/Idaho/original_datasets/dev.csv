SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS BY COMMISSION. Whenever the commission shall be of the opinion that any public utility is failing or omitting or about to fail or omit, to do anything required of it by law, or by any order, decision, rule, direction or requirement of the commission under the provisions of this act, or is doing anything or about to do anything, or permitting anything or about to permit anything to be done, contrary to or in violation of law or of any order, decision, rule, direction or requirement of the commission, under the provisions of this act, it shall direct the attorney of the commission to commence an action or proceeding in the district court in and for the county, or city and county, in which the cause or some part thereof arose, or in which the corporation complained of, if any, has its principal place of business, or in which the person, if any, complained of, resides, in the name of the people of the state of Idaho, for the purpose of having such violations or threatened violations stopped and prevented, either by mandamus or injunction.
The attorney of the commission shall thereupon begin such action or proceeding by petition to such district court, alleging the violation or threatened violation complained of and praying for appropriate relief by way of mandamus or injunction.
It shall thereupon be the duty of the court to specify a time not exceeding twenty (20) days, after the service of the copy of the petition, within which the public utility complained of must answer the petition, and in the meantime said public utility may be restrained. In case of default in answer, or after answer, the court shall immediately inquire into the facts and circumstances of the case. Such corporations or persons as the court may deem necessary or proper to be joined as parties in order to make its judgment, order or writ effective, may be joined as parties. The final judgment in such action or proceedings shall either dismiss the action or proceeding or direct that the writ of mandamus or injunction issue or be made permanent as prayed for in the petition, or in such modified or other form as will afford appropriate relief.
An appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court from such final judgment in the same manner and with the same effect, subject to the provisions of this act, as appeals are taken from judgments of the district court in other actions for mandamus or injunction.",2

ACCESSORIES DEFINED. All persons are accessories who, having knowledge that a felony has been committed:

APPEAL FROM ORDER OF REVOCATION. Any person dissatisfied by any action of the director made hereunder may appeal to any district court of competent jurisdiction, which shall require a trial de novo of all matters of fact and law. Such appeal shall be perfected by filing with the clerk of such district court, within thirty (30) days after the action of which complaint is made, a petition setting forth the action complained of. Such petition shall constitute the complaint, and summons may be issued thereon directed to the director as defendant, and served upon him. The pleadings thereafter shall conform to the practice in other civil proceedings. The court in its decree may sustain, modify, or reverse the action of the director, and shall render its opinion and judgment on the case appealed.",2
A234,I further provide that the person named above shall not be required to furnish bond or bonds in such capacity.,No interested person requested bond from the personal representative.,"15-3-603.  BOND NOT REQUIRED WITHOUT COURT ORDER — EXCEPTIONS. No bond is required of a personal representative appointed in informal proceedings, except (1) upon the appointment of a special administrator; (2) when an executor or other personal representative is appointed to administer an estate under a will containing an express requirement of bond or (3) when bond is required under section 15-3-605 of this chapter. Bond may be required by court order at the time of appointment of a personal representative appointed in any formal proceeding except that bond is not required of a personal representative appointed in formal proceedings if the will relieves the personal representative of bond, unless bond has been requested by an interested party and the court is satisfied that it is desirable. Bond required by any will may be dispensed with in formal proceedings upon determination by the court that it is not necessary. No bond is required of any personal representative who, pursuant to statute, has deposited cash or collateral with an agency of this state to secure performance of his duties. No bond will be required of any domestic bank or trust company.",1

DEMAND FOR BOND BY INTERESTED PERSON. Any person apparently having an interest in the estate worth in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000), or any creditor having a claim in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000), may make a written demand that a personal representative give bond. The demand must be filed with the clerk of the court and a copy mailed to the personal representative, if appointment and qualification have occurred. Thereupon, bond is required, but the requirement ceases if the person demanding bond ceases to be interested in the estate, or if bond is excused as provided in section 15-3-603 or 15-3-604 of this Part. After he has received notice and until the filing of the bond or cessation of the requirement of bond, the personal representative shall refrain from exercising any powers of his office except as necessary to preserve the estate. Failure of the personal representative to meet a requirement of bond by giving suitable bond within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice is cause for his removal and appointment of a successor personal representative.",0

ADJUSTMENTS TO RENT, SERVICES, UTILITIES OR RULES — FEES. (1) A landlord may increase or decrease rents only after ninety (90) days’ written notice to the tenants.
(2)  Rental rates shall at all times be reasonable. Factors to be considered in determining whether a change in rent is reasonable are as follows:
(a)  The rent provided in previous and current rental agreements between the landlord and tenant;
(b)  The rent charged by comparable marinas, taking into account such factors as location, facilities, condition, services and other relevant factors;
(c)  The landlord’s costs associated with owning, controlling and maintaining the marina, including the uplands, to the extent reasonably necessary to support the marina facilities which serve the floating home, moorage area and the landlord’s need for realizing a reasonable rate of return over such costs;
(d)  The availability and costs of alternative long-term float home moorage sites;
(e)  The need to maintain price stability in a market restricted by state regulation of navigable waters and limited availability of float home moorage sites;
(f)  The opportunity costs, if any, borne by the landlord by not converting the floating home marina, including uplands, to other uses; and
(g)  Any other circumstances justifying a rental rate.
(3)  If twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the tenants within a marina, or the [the] marina owner, assert that a moorage rental increase is unreasonable under any circumstances, the dispute shall be resolved by arbitration. The tenants must appoint a single party to act as their agent in the arbitration proceeding.
(a)  The tenants’ agent and the marina owner shall mutually agree upon one (1) or more arbitrators. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon one (1) or more arbitrators, the parties may petition the district court in the judicial district in which the marina in question is situated, which shall appoint an arbitrator or panel of arbitrators for the parties.
(b)  In determining what constitutes a reasonable increase in a moorage rental rate the arbitrator shall consider and make written findings on each of the factors set forth in subsection (2) of this section.
(c)  The arbitrator shall afford any party to the arbitration an opportunity to be heard, if requested, as provided herein.
(i)   A hearing may be requested by a party requesting arbitration by including the request for hearing in the request for arbitration;
(ii)  Other parties to the arbitration may request a hearing within five (5) business days after service upon them of the request for arbitration;
(iii) The hearing may be informal in nature provided the arbitrator adopts a hearing procedure that reasonably affords each party to the arbitration an opportunity to be heard;
(iv)  The arbitrator shall issue written findings and conclusions within sixty (60) days of the appointment of the arbitrator, unless such time is extended by the written stipulation of the parties or upon a finding by the arbitrator that additional time is reasonably required;
(v)   The costs of arbitration and the fees of the arbitrator shall be paid one-half (1/2) by the tenants and one-half (1/2) by the marina owner.
(4)  Except as provided herein, rental increases shall be uniform throughout the floating home marina. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision:
(a)  When rents within a floating home marina are structured by reason of slip or floating home size, amenities, slip location or otherwise, rental increases shall be uniform among all floating homes in the same rent tier; and
(b)  A rental agreement may include an escalation clause for a pro rata share of any increase or decrease in the floating home marina’s property taxes, utility assessments or other services as included in the monthly rental charge, after the effective date of such a change.
(5)  No fees may be charged except for rent, services and utilities actually provided.
(6)  No fees can be charged for services unless the services are listed in the rental agreement or unless ninety (90) days’ notice is given.
(7)  A tenant shall not be charged a fee for the enforcement of any of the rules and regulations of the floating home marina, except as provided in the rental agreement or rules and regulations of the floating home marina.
(8)  Unless the tenant specifically requests the service from the landlord in writing, a tenant shall not be charged a fee for entry, installation, hookup or improvements as a condition of tenancy except for an actual fee or cost imposed by a local governmental ordinance or requirement directly related to the occupancy of the specific moorage site where the floating home is located and incurred as a portion of the development of the floating home marina as a whole. However, reasonable improvements and maintenance requirements may be included in the floating home marina rules and regulations. The landlord shall not require a tenant or prospective tenant to purchase, rent or lease goods or services for improvements from any person, company or corporation.
(9)  Where the landlord provides master meter utilities to a tenant, the cost of the utilities must be separately stated each billing period along with the opening and closing meter readings. The landlord must also post the current rates charged by the utility in at least one (1) conspicuous place in the floating home marina.
(10) The landlord shall maintain year round facilities for garbage and trash disposal from the floating home marina.
(11) The landlord shall maintain entry lights and common area lighting, if any, in good working order.

(1)  The sheriff of a county, on behalf of the state of Idaho, must, within ninety (90) days after the filing of an application by any person who is not disqualified from possessing or receiving a firearm under state or federal law and has otherwise complied with the requirements of this section, issue an enhanced license to the person to carry concealed weapons on his person.

The license application must be in a form to be prescribed by the director of the Idaho state police and must meet the following requirements:

A copy of the certificate of successful completion of the handgun course, in a form to be prescribed by the director of the Idaho state police and signed by the course instructor, must be submitted to the sheriff at the time of filing an application under this section. Certified instructors of handgun courses when filing an application under this section shall not be required to submit such certificates but must submit a copy of their current instructor’s credential. The sheriff must accept as a qualifying handgun course a personal protection course offered by the national rifle association or an equivalent, provided that all personal protection or equivalent courses must meet the following requirements:
(i)  The course instructor is certified by the national rifle association, or by another nationally recognized organization that customarily certifies firearms instructors, as an instructor in personal protection with handguns, or the course instructor is certified by the Idaho peace officers standards and training council as a firearms instructor;
(ii)  The course is at least eight (8) hours in duration;
(iii)  The course is taught face to face and not by electronic or other means; and

(a)  The license must provide the licensee’s name, address, date of birth and the driver’s license number or state identification card number if used for identification in applying for the license;

(1) Public utilities, assignees or other issuers may issue energy cost recovery bonds upon approval by the commission in an energy cost financing order.
(2)  Public utilities and assignees may sell and assign all or portions of their interest in energy cost property. Public utilities and assignees may sell or assign their interests to one (1) or more assignees or other issuers that make that property the basis for issuance of energy cost recovery bonds to the extent approved in the pertinent energy cost financing order. To the extent approved in the pertinent energy cost financing orders, public utilities and assignees may also pledge energy cost property as collateral, directly or indirectly, for energy cost recovery bonds providing for a security interest in the energy cost property, in the manner as set forth in section 61-1505, Idaho Code. Energy cost property may be sold or assigned by:
(a)  The public utility, assignee or other issuer or a trustee for the holders of energy cost recovery bonds in connection with the exercise of remedies upon a default; or
(b)  Any person acquiring the energy cost property after a sale or assignment pursuant to this subsection.
(3)  To the extent that any interest in energy cost property is so sold or assigned, or is so pledged as collateral, the commission shall authorize the public utility to contract with an assignee or other issuer that it will continue to operate its system to provide service to its customers, will collect amounts with respect to the energy cost bond charges for the benefit and account of the assignee or other issuer, and will account for and remit these amounts to or for the account of the assignee or other issuer. Contracting with the assignee or other issuer in accordance with that authorization shall not impair or negate the characterization of the sale, assignment or pledge as an absolute transfer, a true sale or security interest, as applicable.
(4)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any requirement under this chapter or an energy cost financing order that the commission take action with respect to the subject matter of an energy cost financing order shall be binding upon the commission, as it may be constituted from time to time, and any successor agency exercising functions similar to the commission. The commission shall have no authority to rescind, alter or amend any such requirement under this chapter or an energy cost financing order; provided however, that nothing in this subsection shall preclude adjustments of the energy cost bond charges in accordance with the provisions of section 61-1503, Idaho Code. The issuance of energy cost recovery bonds, any related transfer or pledge of energy cost recovery property and any other transactions incidental to such issuance shall be exempt from the provisions of sections 61-901 through 61-908, Idaho Code, upon approval by the commission in an energy cost financing order. The commission shall include in any energy cost financing order any additional approvals that may be required in connection with such issuance under applicable law.

(1) The emergency communications fee provided pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be a uniform amount not to exceed one dollar ($1.00) per month per access or interconnected VoIP service line, and such fee shall be used exclusively to finance the initiation, maintenance, operation, enhancement and governance of a consolidated emergency communications system and provide for the reimbursement of telecommunications providers for implementing enhanced consolidated emergency systems as provided for in section 31-4804A, Idaho Code. All emergency communications fees collected and expended pursuant to this section shall be audited by an independent, third-party auditor ordinarily retained by the governing board for auditing purposes. The purpose of the audit as related to emergency communications systems is to verify the accuracy and completeness of fees collected and costs expended.
(2)  The fee shall be imposed upon and collected from purchasers of access lines or interconnected VoIP service lines with a service address or place of primary use within the county or 911 service area on a monthly basis by all telecommunications providers of such services. The fee may be listed as a separate item on customers’ monthly bills.
(3)  The telecommunications providers shall remit such fee to the county treasurer’s office or the administrator for the 911 service area based upon the 911 service area from which the fees were collected. In the event the telecommunications provider remits such fees based upon the emergency communications fee billed to the customer, a deduction shall be allowed for uncollected amounts when such amounts are treated as bad debt for financial reporting purposes.
(4)  From every remittance to the governing body made on or before the date when the same becomes due, the telecommunications provider required to remit the same shall be entitled to deduct and retain one percent (1%) of the collected amount as the cost of administration for collecting the charge. Telecommunications providers will be allowed to list the surcharge as a separate item on the telephone subscriber’s bill and shall have no obligation to take any legal action to enforce the collection of any charge, nor be held liable for such uncollected amounts.
(5)  Use of fees. The emergency communications fee provided hereunder shall be used only to pay for the lease, purchase or maintenance of emergency communications equipment for basic and enhanced consolidated emergency systems, and next generation consolidated emergency systems (NG911), including necessary computer hardware, software, database provisioning, training, salaries directly related to such systems, costs of establishing such systems, management, maintenance and operation of hardware and software applications and agreed-to reimbursement costs of telecommunications providers related to the operation of such systems. Use of the emergency communications fee should, if possible, coincide with the strategic goals as identified by the Idaho public safety communications commission in its annual report to the legislature. However, the county or 911 service area governing board has final authority on lawful expenditures. All other expenditures necessary to operate such systems and other normal and necessary safety or law enforcement functions including, but not limited to, those expenditures related to overhead, staffing, dispatching, administrative and other day-to-day operational expenditures, shall continue to be paid through the general funding of the respective governing boards; provided however, that any governing body using the emergency communications fee to pay the salaries of dispatchers as of March 1, 2006, may continue to do so until the beginning of such governing body’s 2007 fiscal year.",2

The trustee didn't breach any fiduciary duty.,"68-10-201.  DETERMINATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF NET INCOME. After a decedent dies, in the case of an estate, or after an income interest in a trust ends, the following rules apply:
(1)  A fiduciary of an estate or of a terminating income interest shall determine the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary under the rules in parts 3 through 5 of this chapter which apply to trustees and the rules in subsection (5) of this section. The fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary who is to receive the specific property.
(2)  A fiduciary shall determine the remaining net income of a decedent’s estate or a terminating income interest under the rules in parts 3 through 5 of this chapter which apply to trustees and by:
(A)  Including in net income all income from property used to discharge liabilities;
(B)  Paying from income or principal, in the fiduciary’s discretion, fees of attorneys, accountants and fiduciaries; court costs and other expenses of administration; and interest on death taxes, but the fiduciary may pay those expenses from income of property passing to a trust for which the fiduciary claims an estate tax marital or charitable deduction only to the extent that the payment of those expenses from income will not cause the reduction or loss of the deduction; and
(C)  Paying from principal all other disbursements made or incurred in connection with the settlement of a decedent’s estate or the winding up of a terminating income interest, including debts, funeral expenses, disposition of remains, and death taxes and related penalties that are apportioned to the estate or terminating income interest by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law.
(3)  A fiduciary shall distribute to a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount outright the interest or any other amount provided by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law from net income determined under subsection (2) of this section or from principal to the extent that net income is insufficient. If a beneficiary is to receive a pecuniary amount outright from a trust after an income interest ends and no interest or other amount is provided for by the terms of the trust or applicable law, the fiduciary shall distribute the interest or other amount to which the beneficiary would be entitled under applicable law if the pecuniary amount were required to be paid under a will.
(4)  A fiduciary shall distribute the net income remaining after distributions required by subsection (3) of this section in the manner described in section 68-10-202, Idaho Code, to all other beneficiaries, including a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount in trust, even if the beneficiary holds an unqualified power to withdraw assets from the trust or other presently exercisable general power of appointment over the trust.
(5)  A fiduciary may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in subsection (1) of this section because of a payment described in section 68-10-501 or 68-10-502, Idaho Code, to the extent that the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent that the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party. The net income and principal receipts from the property are determined by including all of the amounts the fiduciary receives or pays with respect to the property, whether those amounts accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of a decedent’s death or an income interest’s terminating event, and by making a reasonable provision for amounts that the fiduciary believes the estate or terminating income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.",1

CUSTODIAL TRUST — GENERAL. (1) A person may create a custodial trust of property by a written transfer of the property to another person, evidenced by registration or by other instrument of transfer, executed in any lawful manner, naming as beneficiary, an individual who may be the transferor, in which the transferee is designated, in substance, as custodial trustee under the Idaho uniform custodial trust act.
(2)  A person may create a custodial trust of property by a written declaration, evidenced by registration of the property or by other instrument of declaration executed in any lawful manner, describing the property and naming as beneficiary an individual other than the declarant, in which the declarant as titleholder is designated, in substance, as custodial trustee under the Idaho uniform custodial trust act. A registration or other declaration of trust for the sole benefit of the declarant is not a custodial trust under this chapter.
(3)  Title to custodial trust property is in the custodial trustee and the beneficial interest is in the beneficiary.
(4)  Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, a transferor may not terminate a custodial trust.
(5)  The beneficiary, if not incapacitated, or the conservator of an incapacitated beneficiary may terminate a custodial trust by delivering to the custodial trustee a writing signed by the beneficiary or conservator declaring the termination. If not previously terminated, the custodial trust terminates on the death of the beneficiary.
(6)  Any person may augment existing custodial trust property by the addition of other property pursuant to this chapter.
(7)  The transferor may designate, or authorize the designation of, a successor custodial trustee in the trust instrument.
(8)  This chapter does not displace or restrict other means of creating trusts. A trust whose terms do not conform to this chapter may be enforceable according to its terms under other law.",0

The trustee didn't breach any fiduciary duty.,"68-10-201.  DETERMINATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF NET INCOME. After a decedent dies, in the case of an estate, or after an income interest in a trust ends, the following rules apply:
(1)  A fiduciary of an estate or of a terminating income interest shall determine the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary under the rules in parts 3 through 5 of this chapter which apply to trustees and the rules in subsection (5) of this section. The fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary who is to receive the specific property.
(2)  A fiduciary shall determine the remaining net income of a decedent’s estate or a terminating income interest under the rules in parts 3 through 5 of this chapter which apply to trustees and by:
(A)  Including in net income all income from property used to discharge liabilities;
(B)  Paying from income or principal, in the fiduciary’s discretion, fees of attorneys, accountants and fiduciaries; court costs and other expenses of administration; and interest on death taxes, but the fiduciary may pay those expenses from income of property passing to a trust for which the fiduciary claims an estate tax marital or charitable deduction only to the extent that the payment of those expenses from income will not cause the reduction or loss of the deduction; and
(C)  Paying from principal all other disbursements made or incurred in connection with the settlement of a decedent’s estate or the winding up of a terminating income interest, including debts, funeral expenses, disposition of remains, and death taxes and related penalties that are apportioned to the estate or terminating income interest by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law.
(3)  A fiduciary shall distribute to a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount outright the interest or any other amount provided by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law from net income determined under subsection (2) of this section or from principal to the extent that net income is insufficient. If a beneficiary is to receive a pecuniary amount outright from a trust after an income interest ends and no interest or other amount is provided for by the terms of the trust or applicable law, the fiduciary shall distribute the interest or other amount to which the beneficiary would be entitled under applicable law if the pecuniary amount were required to be paid under a will.
(4)  A fiduciary shall distribute the net income remaining after distributions required by subsection (3) of this section in the manner described in section 68-10-202, Idaho Code, to all other beneficiaries, including a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount in trust, even if the beneficiary holds an unqualified power to withdraw assets from the trust or other presently exercisable general power of appointment over the trust.
(5)  A fiduciary may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in subsection (1) of this section because of a payment described in section 68-10-501 or 68-10-502, Idaho Code, to the extent that the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent that the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party. The net income and principal receipts from the property are determined by including all of the amounts the fiduciary receives or pays with respect to the property, whether those amounts accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of a decedent’s death or an income interest’s terminating event, and by making a reasonable provision for amounts that the fiduciary believes the estate or terminating income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.",1
A197,"If the trust income is not sufficient to meet the reasonable living expenses of [Person-2] during her lifetime, taking into account her needs and other resources, I direct that the Trustee shall have the right to invade the principal of the trust to expend for the use and benefit of [Person-2].",[Person-2] terminated the trust by delivering to the trustee a writing signed by herself declaring the termination.,"68-1302.  CUSTODIAL TRUST — GENERAL. (1) A person may create a custodial trust of property by a written transfer of the property to another person, evidenced by registration or by other instrument of transfer, executed in any lawful manner, naming as beneficiary, an individual who may be the transferor, in which the transferee is designated, in substance, as custodial trustee under the Idaho uniform custodial trust act.
(2)  A person may create a custodial trust of property by a written declaration, evidenced by registration of the property or by other instrument of declaration executed in any lawful manner, describing the property and naming as beneficiary an individual other than the declarant, in which the declarant as titleholder is designated, in substance, as custodial trustee under the Idaho uniform custodial trust act. A registration or other declaration of trust for the sole benefit of the declarant is not a custodial trust under this chapter.
(3)  Title to custodial trust property is in the custodial trustee and the beneficial interest is in the beneficiary.
(4)  Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, a transferor may not terminate a custodial trust.
(5)  The beneficiary, if not incapacitated, or the conservator of an incapacitated beneficiary may terminate a custodial trust by delivering to the custodial trustee a writing signed by the beneficiary or conservator declaring the termination. If not previously terminated, the custodial trust terminates on the death of the beneficiary.
(6)  Any person may augment existing custodial trust property by the addition of other property pursuant to this chapter.
(7)  The transferor may designate, or authorize the designation of, a successor custodial trustee in the trust instrument.
(8)  This chapter does not displace or restrict other means of creating trusts. A trust whose terms do not conform to this chapter may be enforceable according to its terms under other law.",0
A197,"If the trust income is not sufficient to meet the reasonable living expenses of [Person-2] during her lifetime, taking into account her needs and other resources, I direct that the Trustee shall have the right to invade the principal of the trust to expend for the use and benefit of [Person-2].",[Person-2] accepted to receive the living expenses from the trust.

DISPARAGEMENT OF PERISHABLE AGRICULTURAL FOOD PRODUCTS — RIGHT OF ACTION FOR DAMAGES. (1) A producer of perishable agricultural food products who suffers actual damages as a result of another person’s disparagement of the producer’s product may bring an action for actual damages in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(2)  The plaintiff shall bear the burden of proof and persuasion as to each element of the cause of action and must prove each element by clear and convincing evidence.
(3)  The plaintiff may only recover actual pecuniary damages. Neither presumed nor punitive damages shall be allowed.
(4)  The disparaging factual statement must be clearly directed at a particular plaintiff’s product. A factual statement regarding a generic group of products, as opposed to a specific producer’s product, shall not serve as the basis for a cause of action.
(5)  Notwithstanding any limitation contained in chapter 2, title 5, Idaho Code, an action under the provisions of this chapter must be commenced within two (2) years after the cause of action accrues and not thereafter.
(6)  This statutory cause of action is not intended to abrogate the common law action for product disparagement or any other cause of action otherwise available.",2

(2)  If, after the effective date of this chapter, a local government allows any development in a floodplain below the flood protection elevation without adequate floodproofing, that development shall not, in the event of a disaster emergency involving flooding in that floodplain, be eligible to receive any matching funds from the state for any federal disaster assistance program which may be available as a result of said flooding in that floodplain. The owner of the development will be required to rely on flood insurance to insure their property against the risk of loss incurred by their development in the floodplain in contravention of the intent of this chapter.",2
