(1)  (a) A person or the representative of an incapacitated or unascertained person who is an heir, devisee, person succeeding to a renounced interest, donee, beneficiary under a testamentary or nontestamentary instrument, donee of a power of appointment, grantee, surviving joint owner or surviving joint tenant, beneficiary of an insurance contract, person designated to take pursuant to a power of appointment exercised by a testamentary or nontestamentary instrument, or otherwise the recipient of any benefit under a testamentary or nontestamentary instrument, may renounce in whole or in part, powers, future interests, specific parts, fractional shares or assets thereof by filing a written instrument within the time and at the place hereinafter provided.
(b)  The instrument shall:
(i)   Describe the property or interest renounced;
(ii)  Be signed by the person renouncing; and
(iii) Declare the renunciation and the extent thereof.
(c)  The appropriate court may direct or permit a trustee under a testamentary or nontestamentary instrument to renounce or to deviate from any power of administration, management or allocation of benefit upon finding that exercise of such power may defeat or impair the accomplishment of the purposes of the trust whether by the imposition of tax or the allocation of beneficial interest inconsistent with such purposes. Such authority shall be exercised after hearing and upon notice to all known persons beneficially interested in such trust or estate, in the manner pursuant to part 4, chapter 1, title 15, Idaho Code.
(2)  Except as provided in subsection (9) of [the] this section, the writing specified in subsection (1) of this section must be filed within nine (9) months after the transfer or the death of the decedent, or donee of the power, whichever is the later, or, if the taker of the property is not then finally ascertained, not later than nine (9) months after the event that determines that the taker of the property or interest is finally ascertained or his interest indefeasibly vested. The writing must be filed in the court of the county where proceedings concerning the decedent’s estate are pending, or where they would be pending if commenced. If an interest in real estate is renounced, a copy of the writing may also be recorded in the office of the recorder in the county in which said real estate lies. A copy of the writing also shall be delivered in person or mailed by registered or certified mail to the personal representative of the decedent, the trustee of any trust in which the interest renounced exists, and no such personal representative, trustee or person shall be liable for any otherwise proper distribution or other disposition made without actual notice of the renunciation.
(3)  Unless the decedent or donee of the power has otherwise indicated, the property or interest renounced passes as if the person renouncing had predeceased the decedent, or if the person renouncing is designated to take under a power of appointment as if the person renouncing had predeceased the donee of the power. A future interest that takes effect in possession or enjoyment after the termination of the estate or interest renounced takes effect as if the person renouncing had predeceased the decedent or the donee of the power. In every case the renunciation relates back for all purposes to the date of death of the decedent or the donee, as the case may be.
(4)  The right to renounce property or an interest therein is barred by:
(a) Assignment, conveyance, encumbrance, pledge or transfer of property therein or any contract therefor;
(b)  Written waiver of the right to renounce; or
(c)  Sale or other disposition of property pursuant to judicial process, made before the renunciation is effective.
(5)  The right to renounce granted by this section exists irrespective of any limitation on the interest of the person renouncing in the nature of a spendthrift provision or similar restriction.
(6)  The renunciation or the written waiver of the right to renounce is binding upon the person renouncing or person waiving and all persons claiming through or under him.
(7)  This section does not abridge the right of any person to assign, convey, release or renounce any property or an interest therein arising under any other statute.
(8)  In clarification and amplification of subsection (1)(a) of this section, and to make clear the existing terms thereof, a renunciation may be made by an agent appointed under a power of attorney, by a conservator or guardian on behalf of an incapacitated person, or by the personal representative or administrator of a deceased person. The ability to renounce on behalf of the person does not need to be specifically set forth in a power of attorney if the power is general in nature.
(9)  The due date for filing a timely disclaimer under subsection (2) of this section, where the decedent died after December 31, 2009, but before December 17, 2010, shall be not earlier than September 19, 2011.",0

DISCRIMINATION AMONG POTENTIAL RESIDENTIAL SUBSCRIBERS PROHIBITED — VIOLATIONS. (1) A system operator shall not deny access to video service to any group of potential residential subscribers because of the income of the residents in the local area in which such group resides.
(2)  For purposes of determining whether a system operator has violated the provisions of this section, cost, density, distance and technological or commercial limitations shall be taken into account. An alleged violation shall only be considered within the description of the service area set forth in a certificate of franchise authority. The inability to serve an end user because a holder of such certificate is prohibited from placing its own facilities in a building or property shall not be found to be a violation of the provisions of this section. The requirements of this subsection shall not be construed as authorizing any build-out requirements on a system operator.
(3)  Any potential residential subscriber or group of residential subscribers who believes it is being denied access to services in violation of the provisions of this section may file a complaint with the governing authority of the political subdivision within the service area of the system operator in which the subscribers or potential subscribers reside. The complaint shall provide a clear statement of the facts and information upon which it bases the complaint. Upon receipt of any such complaint, the governing authority shall serve a copy of the complaint and supporting materials upon the subject system operator, and shall require the system operator to submit a written answer and other relevant information in response to the complaint within thirty (30) days from service of the complaint on the system operator. If the governing authority, after examination of the complaint and answer thereto, is not successful in informally resolving the dispute, the governing authority may require the system operator and the complainants to enter into mediation. Alternatively, either party may seek judicial determination of the issues. If a court finds that the holder of a certificate of franchise authority is denying access to video service to any group of potential residential subscribers because of the income level of the residents in the local area in which such group resides, the holder of a certificate of franchise authority shall provide access to video service to the affected group of potential subscribers within a reasonable period of time, as specified by the court, to cure such noncompliance.",2
