The dually enrolled student’s primary education provider shall be the provider in which the student is registered for the majority of the coursework. At no time may the dual enrollment provisions be used to circumvent a public charter school’s lottery requirements.

Additionally, a student shall be eligible if he achieves a minimum composite, core or survey test score within the average or higher-than-average range as established by the test service utilized on any nationally normed test. Demonstrated proficiency shall be used to determine eligibility for the current and next following school years. School districts and public charter schools shall provide to nonpublic students who wish to participate in dual enrollment activities the opportunity to take state tests or other standardized tests given to all regularly enrolled public school students.
(5)  A public school student who has been unable to maintain academic eligibility is ineligible to participate in nonacademic public school activities as a nonpublic school or public charter school student for the duration of the school year in which the student becomes academically ineligible and for the following academic year.

(4)  If termination of parental rights is granted and the child is placed in the guardianship or legal custody of the department of health and welfare, the court, upon petition, shall conduct a hearing as to the future status of the child within twelve (12) months of the order of termination of parental rights, and every twelve (12) months subsequently until the child is adopted or is in a placement sanctioned by the court.",2

(1)  Require or attempt to require any equipment dealer to order or accept delivery of any equipment or parts or any equipment with special features or accessories not included in the base list price of such equipment as publicly advertised by the supplier which the equipment dealer has not voluntarily ordered;
(2)  Require or attempt to require any equipment dealer to enter into any agreement, whether written or oral, supplementing or amending an existing dealer agreement with such supplier unless such amendment or supplementary agreement is imposed on other similarly situated dealers in the state;
(3)  Refuse to deliver in reasonable quantities and within a reasonable time after receipt of the equipment dealer’s order, to any equipment dealer having a dealer agreement for the retail sale of new equipment sold or distributed by such supplier, equipment covered by such dealer agreement specifically advertised or represented by such supplier to be available for immediate delivery. The failure to deliver any such equipment shall not be considered a violation of the provisions of this chapter when deliveries are based on prior retail sales ordering histories, the priority given to the sequence in which the orders are received or manufacturing schedules or if such failure is due to prudent and reasonable restriction on extension of credit by the supplier to the equipment dealer, an act of God, work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor difficulty, a bona fide shortage of materials, freight embargo or other cause over which the supplier has no control;
(4)  Terminate, cancel or fail to renew the dealer agreement of any equipment dealer or substantially change the dealer’s competitive circumstances, attempt to terminate or cancel, or threaten not to renew the dealer agreement or attempt or threaten to substantially change the dealer’s competitive circumstances without good cause. For purposes of this chapter, the fact that a dealer agreement allows an event, act or omission does not control whether such event, act or omission resulted in a substantial change in the dealer’s competitive circumstances. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to apply to a discontinuation of or change in the product line of a supplier;
(5)  Condition the renewal, continuation or extension of a dealer agreement on the equipment dealer’s substantial renovation of the equipment dealer’s place of business or on the construction, purchase, acquisition or rental of a new place of business by the equipment dealer, unless:
(a)  The supplier has advised the equipment dealer in writing of its demand for such renovation, construction, purchase, acquisition or rental within a reasonable time prior to the effective date of the proposed date of renewal or extension, but in no case less than one (1) year; and
(b)  The supplier demonstrates the need for such change in the place of business and the reasonableness of the demand with respect to marketing and servicing the supplier’s products and any significant economic conditions existing at the time in the equipment dealer’s trade area, and the equipment dealer does not make a good faith effort to complete such construction or renovation plans within one (1) year;
(6)  Discriminate in the prices charged for equipment of like grade and quality sold by the supplier to similarly situated dealers in this state where the effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in a line of commerce. The provisions of this subsection do not prevent the use of differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale or delivery of equipment resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such equipment is sold or delivered; provided that nothing shall prevent a supplier from offering a lower price in order to meet an equally low price of a competitor, or the services or facilities furnished by a competitor;
(7)  Unreasonably withhold consent for an equipment dealer to change the capital structure of the equipment dealership or the means by which it is financed, provided that the equipment dealer meets the reasonable capital requirements of the supplier;
(8)  Prevent, by contract or otherwise, any equipment dealer or any officer, member, partner or stockholder of an equipment dealership from selling, assigning, or transferring any interest or portion thereof held by any of them in the equipment dealership to any other person or party; provided, however, that no equipment dealer, officer, partner, member or stockholder shall have the right to sell, transfer, or assign the equipment dealership or the power of management or control thereof without the written consent of the supplier, except that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld if the buyer, transferee, or assignee meets the reasonable financial, business experience and character standards of the supplier. Should a supplier determine that the designated transferee is not acceptable, the supplier shall provide the equipment dealer with written notice of the supplier’s objections and specific reasons for withholding its consent within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of notice from the equipment dealer;
(9)  Require an equipment dealer to assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver or estoppel which would relieve any person from liability imposed by this chapter;
(10) (a) Unreasonably withhold consent, in the event of the death of the equipment dealer or the principal owner of the equipment dealership, to the transfer of the equipment dealer’s or the principal owner’s interest in the equipment dealership to another individual, if the individual meets the reasonable financial, business experience and character standards of the supplier. A supplier shall have sixty (60) days to consider a request to make a transfer to an individual. If, within that period, the supplier determines that the individual does not meet the reasonable financial, business experience and character standards of the supplier, it shall provide the dealership, heirs to the dealership, or the estate of the dealer with written notice of its objection and the specific reasons for withholding its consent. If the individual reasonably satisfies the supplier’s objections within sixty (60) days after notice thereof, the supplier shall approve the transfer. Nothing in this paragraph shall entitle a qualified individual to continue to operate the dealership without the consent of the supplier;
(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsection, in the event that a supplier and equipment dealer have duly executed an agreement concerning succession rights prior to the equipment dealer’s death, and if such agreement has not been revoked, such agreement shall be observed;
(11) Cause the equipment dealer to refrain from participation in the management, investment, acquisition or sale of any other related product or product line of equipment, parts or accessories, from the same or separate locations;
(12) Fail to compensate a dealer for preparation and delivery of equipment that the supplier sells or leases for use within this state and that the dealer prepares for delivery and delivers.",2

(b)  An objection to an appointment can be made only in formal proceedings. In case of objection the priorities stated in subsection (a) of this section apply except that
(1)  if the estate appears to be more than adequate to meet exemptions and costs of administration but inadequate to discharge anticipated unsecured claims, the court, on petition of creditors, may appoint any qualified person;
(2)  in case of objection to appointment of a person other than one whose priority is determined by will by an heir or devisee appearing to have a substantial interest in the estate, the court may appoint a person who is acceptable to heirs and devisees whose interests in the estate appear to be worth in total more than half of the probable distributable value, or, in default of this accord any suitable person.
(c)  A person entitled to letters under (2) through (5) of subsection (a) of this section may nominate a qualified person to act as personal representative. Any person aged eighteen (18) and over may renounce his right to an appointment by appropriate writing filed with the court.

This provision shall not apply with respect to a will, trust or other instrument that manifests an intent that a contrary rule shall apply.
(2)  The personal representative, trustee, other fiduciary or any affected beneficiary under the will, trust or other instrument may bring a proceeding to determine whether the decedent intended that the will, trust or other instrument should be construed in a manner other than as provided in subsection (1) of this section.

In a proceeding under this section, the court may consider extrinsic evidence that contradicts the plain meaning of the will, trust or other instrument. The court shall have the power to modify a provision of the will, trust or other instrument that refers to the federal estate tax or generation-skipping tax laws as described in subsection (1) of this section to:
(a)  Conform the terms to the decedent’s intention; or

As used in the subsection, ""interested persons"" means persons whose consent would be required in order to achieve a binding settlement were the settlement to be approved by the court. In the case of a trust, the agreement may be by nonjudicial settlement agreement pursuant to chapter 8, title 15, Idaho Code. Any interested person may petition the court to approve the agreement or to determine whether all interested persons are parties to the agreement, either in person or by adequate representation where permitted by law, and whether the agreement contains terms the court could have properly approved.",2

GENERAL DUTIES — RELATION AND LIABILITY TO PERSONS INTERESTED IN ESTATE — STANDING TO SUE. (a) A personal representative is a fiduciary who shall observe the standards of care applicable to trustees as described by section 15-7-302 of this code. A personal representative is under a duty to settle and distribute the estate of the decedent in accordance with the terms of any probated and effective will and this code, and as expeditiously and efficiently as is consistent with the best interests of the estate. He shall use the authority conferred upon him by this code, the terms of the will, if any, and any order in proceedings to which he is party for the best interests of successors to the estate.
(b)  A personal representative shall not be surcharged for acts of administration or distribution if the conduct in question was authorized at the time. Subject to other obligations of administration, an informally probated will is authority to administer and distribute the estate according to its terms. An order of appointment of a personal representative, whether issued in informal or formal proceedings, is authority to distribute apparently intestate assets to the heirs of the decedent if, at the time of distribution, the personal representative is not aware of a pending testacy proceeding, a proceeding to vacate an order entered in an earlier testacy proceeding, a formal proceeding questioning his appointment or fitness to continue, or a supervised administration proceeding. Nothing in this section affects the duty of the personal representative to administer and distribute the estate in accordance with the rights of claimants, the surviving spouse, any minor and dependent children and any pretermitted child of the decedent as described elsewhere in this code.
(c)  Except as to proceedings which do not survive the death of the decedent, a personal representative of a decedent domiciled in this state at his death has the same standing to sue and be sued in the courts of this state and the courts of any other jurisdiction as his decedent had immediately prior to death.",1

Any sale or encumbrance to the personal representative, his spouse, agent or attorney, or any corporation or trust in which he has a substantial beneficial interest, or any transaction which is affected by a substantial conflict of interest on the part of the personal representative, is voidable by any person interested in the estate except one (1) who has consented after fair disclosure, unless:

(e)  The product seller sold the product after the expiration date placed on the product or its package by the manufacturer.

(3)  In any product liability action, the manufacturer of the product shall be indemnified by the product seller of the product for any judgment rendered against the manufacturer and shall also be reimbursed for reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in defending such action:
(a)  If the product seller provided the plans or specifications for the manufacture or preparation of the product;
(b)  If such plans or specifications were a substantial cause of the product’s alleged defect; and
(c)  If the product was manufactured in compliance with and according to the plans or specifications of the seller.
The provisions of this subsection shall not apply if the manufacturer had knowledge or with the exercise of reasonable and diligent care should have had knowledge of the defect in the product.

(g)  Take such other acts as are necessary to accomplish the object of a fair, swift, and cost-effective determination of the case.
(2)  An evaluator shall not decide motions to dismiss, motions to add or change parties in the case, or motions for summary judgment. Any such motion shall be presented to the trial court for determination.
(3)  After the case is assigned to the evaluator, service shall be made consistent with rule 5 of the Idaho rules of civil procedure, except that documents used in the evaluation shall be filed with the evaluator instead of the court.

(1) The purpose of this act is to establish a resource for Idaho’s education and library system in providing broadband, wireless local area network (LAN) and related services to students. The legislature finds that Idaho benefits from a consistent and adequate bandwidth connection to and between its districts and schools, inclusive of grades K through 12, and to its libraries. It is the intent of the legislature that:
(a)  State resources be made available to support Idaho’s E-rate eligible entities with technical, E-rate, security, contracting and procurement guidance, and funding distribution;
(b)  E-rate eligible entities shall have the ability to collaborate regionally and intrastate for broadband and related services;
(c)  Districts shall have the ability to collaborate regionally and intrastate for wireless LAN services; and
(d)  E-rate eligible entities apply for and pursue, in good faith, E-rate funding.
(2)  As used in this chapter:
(a)  ""Districts"" means Idaho public schools grades K through 12, the Idaho digital learning academy, the Idaho department of juvenile corrections’ education programs and the school for the deaf and the blind.
(b)  ""E-rate"" means the schools and libraries program of the universal service fund that is administered by the universal service administrative company under the direction of the federal communications commission.
(c)  ""E-rate eligible entities"" means Idaho public schools grades K through 12, the Idaho digital learning academy, the Idaho department of juvenile corrections education programs, the school for the deaf and the blind and the Idaho public libraries.",2

The power of a person to leave property by will, and the rights of creditors, devisees, and heirs to his property are subject to the restrictions and limitations contained in this code to facilitate the prompt settlement of estates. Upon the death of a person, his separate property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by his last will, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving lapse, renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of testate estates, or in the absence of testamentary disposition to his heirs, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of intestate estates, and upon the death of a husband or wife, the decedent’s share of their community property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by his last will, or in the absence of testamentary disposition, to the surviving spouse, but all of their community property which is under the management and control of the decedent is subject to his debts and administration, and that portion of their community property which is not under the management and control of the decedent but which is necessary to carry out the provisions of his will is subject to administration; but the devolution of all the above described property is subject to rights to homestead allowance, exempt property, to renunciation to rights of creditors, elective share of the surviving spouse and to administration.",1

and personal and of whatsoever kind or character and wheresoever
found, to have and hold forever.",The testator divorced with his/her spouse after he/she executed this will.,"15-2-508.  REVOCATION BY DIVORCE — NO REVOCATION BY OTHER CHANGES OF CIRCUMSTANCES. If after executing a will the testator is divorced or his marriage annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any disposition or appointment of property made by the will to the former spouse, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse, and any nomination of the former spouse as executor, trustee, conservator, or guardian, unless the will expressly provides otherwise. Property prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment passes as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, and other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the decedent. If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by testator’s remarriage to the former spouse. For purposes of this section, divorce or annulment means any divorce or annulment which would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse within the meaning of subsection (b) of section 15-2-802 of this code. A decree of separation which does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section. No change of circumstances other than as described in this section revokes a will.",0

and personal and of whatsoever kind or character and wheresoever

(a) After commencement of any civil action based upon a claim for relief arising in tort, from property damage, personal injury or wrongful death, any claimant may at any time, no later than ten (10) days before the trial, serve upon an adverse party, a written offer of settlement, offering to settle his claim in such action and to stipulate to a judgment for a sum certain, including any attorney fees allowable by law and costs of litigation then accrued.
(b)  If the adverse party, at any time after service of such offer of settlement and prior to its revocation, serves written notice that the offer is accepted, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance, together with proof of service thereof, and thereupon judgment shall be entered for the amount of the offer. In the event that an offer of settlement is revoked by a claimant or not accepted, evidence of the offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs or to award interest pursuant to this section.
(c)  If such offer of settlement is not accepted prior to trial pursuant to subsection (b) above, and the action reaches a final judgment by the court after trial, the court shall inquire as to whether any prevailing claimant made an offer of settlement, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, which an adverse party failed to accept. If the court finds that such claimant has recovered an amount equal to or greater than his offer of settlement, the court shall add to the judgment, annual interest on the amount contained in such offer, computed from the date that the offer of settlement was served and shall enter judgment accordingly. For purposes of such computation, the last offer of settlement which was equal to or less than the damages awarded such claimant, together with the costs and attorney fees, if any, awarded to him shall be used. A subsequent offer made pursuant to subsection (a) revokes any previous offer.
(d)  For purposes of this section, ""annual interest"" shall mean the rate specified in section 28-22-104(2), Idaho Code.",2

(c)  A person entitled to letters under (2) through (5) of subsection (a) of this section may nominate a qualified person to act as personal representative.

(e)  Appointment of one who does not have priority, including priority resulting from renunciation or nomination determined pursuant to this section, may be made only in formal proceedings. Before appointing one without priority, the court must determine that those having priority, although given notice of the proceedings, have failed to request appointment or to nominate another for appointment, and that administration is necessary.

COMMUNITY PROPERTY — INCOME FROM SEPARATE AND COMMUNITY PROPERTY — CONVEYANCE BETWEEN SPOUSES. (1) All other property acquired after marriage by either husband or wife is community property. The income, including the rents, issues and profits, of all property, separate or community, is community property unless the conveyance by which it is acquired provides or both spouses, by written agreement specifically so providing, declare that all or specifically designated property and the income, including the rents, issues and profits, from all or the specifically designated property shall be the separate property of one of the spouses or the income, including the rents, issues and profits, from all or specifically designated separate property be the separate property of the spouse to whom the property belongs.

If after executing a will the testator is divorced or his marriage annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any disposition or appointment of property made by the will to the former spouse, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse, and any nomination of the former spouse as executor, trustee, conservator, or guardian, unless the will expressly provides otherwise. Property prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment passes as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, and other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the decedent. If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by testator’s remarriage to the former spouse. For purposes of this section, divorce or annulment means any divorce or annulment which would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse within the meaning of subsection (b) of section 15-2-802 of this code. A decree of separation which does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section.

(3)  other devisees of the decedent;
(4)  the surviving spouse of the decedent;

(b)  An objection to an appointment can be made only in formal proceedings. In case of objection the priorities stated in subsection (a) of this section apply except that
(1)  if the estate appears to be more than adequate to meet exemptions and costs of administration but inadequate to discharge anticipated unsecured claims, the court, on petition of creditors, may appoint any qualified person;
(2)  in case of objection to appointment of a person other than one whose priority is determined by will by an heir or devisee appearing to have a substantial interest in the estate, the court may appoint a person who is acceptable to heirs and devisees whose interests in the estate appear to be worth in total more than half of the probable distributable value, or, in default of this accord any suitable person.
(c)  A person entitled to letters under (2) through (5) of subsection (a) of this section may nominate a qualified person to act as personal representative.

(e)  Appointment of one who does not have priority, including priority resulting from renunciation or nomination determined pursuant to this section, may be made only in formal proceedings. Before appointing one without priority, the court must determine that those having priority, although given notice of the proceedings, have failed to request appointment or to nominate another for appointment, and that administration is necessary.
(f)  No person is qualified to serve as a personal representative who is:
(1)  under the age of eighteen (18);
(2)  a person whom the court finds unsuitable in formal proceedings.
(g)  A personal representative appointed by a court of the decedent’s domicile has priority over all other persons except where the decedent’s will nominates different persons to be personal representative in this state and in the state of domicile.

The power of a person to leave property by will, and the rights of creditors, devisees, and heirs to his property are subject to the restrictions and limitations contained in this code to facilitate the prompt settlement of estates. Upon the death of a person, his separate property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by his last will, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving lapse, renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of testate estates, or in the absence of testamentary disposition to his heirs, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of intestate estates, and upon the death of a husband or wife, the decedent’s share of their community property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by his last will, or in the absence of testamentary disposition, to the surviving spouse, but all of their community property which is under the management and control of the decedent is subject to his debts and administration, and that portion of their community property which is not under the management and control of the decedent but which is necessary to carry out the provisions of his will is subject to administration; but the devolution of all the above described property is subject to rights to homestead allowance, exempt property, to renunciation to rights of creditors, elective share of the surviving spouse and to administration.",1

(1)  (a) A person or the representative of an incapacitated or unascertained person who is an heir, devisee, person succeeding to a renounced interest, donee, beneficiary under a testamentary or nontestamentary instrument, donee of a power of appointment, grantee, surviving joint owner or surviving joint tenant, beneficiary of an insurance contract, person designated to take pursuant to a power of appointment exercised by a testamentary or nontestamentary instrument, or otherwise the recipient of any benefit under a testamentary or nontestamentary instrument, may renounce in whole or in part, powers, future interests, specific parts, fractional shares or assets thereof by filing a written instrument within the time and at the place hereinafter provided.
(b)  The instrument shall:
(i)   Describe the property or interest renounced;
(ii)  Be signed by the person renouncing; and
(iii) Declare the renunciation and the extent thereof.
(c)  The appropriate court may direct or permit a trustee under a testamentary or nontestamentary instrument to renounce or to deviate from any power of administration, management or allocation of benefit upon finding that exercise of such power may defeat or impair the accomplishment of the purposes of the trust whether by the imposition of tax or the allocation of beneficial interest inconsistent with such purposes. Such authority shall be exercised after hearing and upon notice to all known persons beneficially interested in such trust or estate, in the manner pursuant to part 4, chapter 1, title 15, Idaho Code.
(2)  Except as provided in subsection (9) of [the] this section, the writing specified in subsection (1) of this section must be filed within nine (9) months after the transfer or the death of the decedent, or donee of the power, whichever is the later, or, if the taker of the property is not then finally ascertained, not later than nine (9) months after the event that determines that the taker of the property or interest is finally ascertained or his interest indefeasibly vested. The writing must be filed in the court of the county where proceedings concerning the decedent’s estate are pending, or where they would be pending if commenced. If an interest in real estate is renounced, a copy of the writing may also be recorded in the office of the recorder in the county in which said real estate lies. A copy of the writing also shall be delivered in person or mailed by registered or certified mail to the personal representative of the decedent, the trustee of any trust in which the interest renounced exists, and no such personal representative, trustee or person shall be liable for any otherwise proper distribution or other disposition made without actual notice of the renunciation.
(3)  Unless the decedent or donee of the power has otherwise indicated, the property or interest renounced passes as if the person renouncing had predeceased the decedent, or if the person renouncing is designated to take under a power of appointment as if the person renouncing had predeceased the donee of the power. A future interest that takes effect in possession or enjoyment after the termination of the estate or interest renounced takes effect as if the person renouncing had predeceased the decedent or the donee of the power. In every case the renunciation relates back for all purposes to the date of death of the decedent or the donee, as the case may be.
(4)  The right to renounce property or an interest therein is barred by:
(a) Assignment, conveyance, encumbrance, pledge or transfer of property therein or any contract therefor;
(b)  Written waiver of the right to renounce; or
(c)  Sale or other disposition of property pursuant to judicial process, made before the renunciation is effective.
(5)  The right to renounce granted by this section exists irrespective of any limitation on the interest of the person renouncing in the nature of a spendthrift provision or similar restriction.
(6)  The renunciation or the written waiver of the right to renounce is binding upon the person renouncing or person waiving and all persons claiming through or under him.
(7)  This section does not abridge the right of any person to assign, convey, release or renounce any property or an interest therein arising under any other statute.
(8)  In clarification and amplification of subsection (1)(a) of this section, and to make clear the existing terms thereof, a renunciation may be made by an agent appointed under a power of attorney, by a conservator or guardian on behalf of an incapacitated person, or by the personal representative or administrator of a deceased person. The ability to renounce on behalf of the person does not need to be specifically set forth in a power of attorney if the power is general in nature.
(9)  The due date for filing a timely disclaimer under subsection (2) of this section, where the decedent died after December 31, 2009, but before December 17, 2010, shall be not earlier than September 19, 2011.",0

(1) To the extent required by the federal clean air act, the federal clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act for state primacy over any delegated or authorized programs, even if the record is otherwise exempt from disclosure under this chapter, any person may inspect and copy:
(a)  Air pollution emission data;
(b)  The content of any title V operating permit;
(c)  The name and address of any Idaho pollutant discharge elimination system (IPDES) applicant or permittee;
(d)  The content of any IPDES permit;
(e)  IPDES permit applications, and information required to be submitted by IPDES application forms, whether the information is submitted on the application forms themselves or in any attachments used to supply information required by the application forms;
(f)  Effluent data or a standard or limitation, as defined in 40 CFR 2.302;
(g)  The name and address of any applicant or permittee for a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility permit pursuant to chapter 44, title 39, Idaho Code; and
(h)  Any other record required to be provided to or obtained by the department of environmental quality pursuant to the federal clean air act, the federal clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act, and the implementing state statutes, federal regulations and state rules, unless the record is a trade secret.
(2)  For purposes of this section, a record, or a portion of the record, is a ""trade secret"" if the information contained in the record is a trade secret within the meaning of the Idaho trade secrets act, sections 48-801, et seq., Idaho Code, including commercial or financial information which, if disclosed, could cause substantial competitive harm to the person from whom the record was obtained.
(3)  Any record, or portion of a record, provided to or obtained by the department of environmental quality and identified by the person providing the record as a trade secret shall not be disclosed to the public and shall be kept confidential according to the procedures established in this section.
(4)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the disclosure of a trade secret by the department of environmental quality:
(a)  To any officer, employee, or authorized representative of the state or the United States, under a continuing claim of confidentiality, as necessary to carry out the provisions of state or federal law, or when relevant to any proceeding thereunder;
(b)  As determined necessary by the director of the department of environmental quality (under a continuing confidentiality claim) to protect the public health and safety from imminent and substantial endangerment;
(c)  As required by state or federal law, including section 74-115(3), Idaho Code, under a continuing claim of confidentiality and subsection (1) of this section; or
(d)  With the consent of the person from whom the record is obtained.
(5)  It shall be the responsibility of any person providing a record to the department of environmental quality to give notice of the existence of a trade secret on each page or other portion of information at the time of submittal, and such person shall have the burden of demonstrating that the information is a trade secret.
(6)  Notwithstanding the time frames set forth in section 74-103(2), Idaho Code, when a request is made to the department of environmental quality pursuant to the provisions of this chapter for the disclosure of information for which a trade secret claim has been made, and the information has not been demonstrated to be a trade secret to the satisfaction of the director of the department of environmental quality, within three (3) working days of receipt of the request for the disclosure of the information, the department of environmental quality shall provide a written request for substantiation to the person making the confidentiality claim. A response shall be submitted to the department of environmental quality by the person claiming the trade secret protection within ten (10) working days after receipt of the request for substantiation, or the information subject to the claim shall be disclosed without further notice. Upon receipt of a timely response to the request for substantiation, the director of the department of environmental quality shall determine whether the information is a trade secret subject to protection.
(a)  If it is determined that the information, or any portion of the information, is a trade secret, within three (3) working days after receipt of the response, the director of the department of environmental quality shall notify the person requesting the information that the request is denied pursuant to subsections (4) and (5) of section 74-103, Idaho Code.
(b)  If it is determined that the information, or any portion of the information, is not a trade secret and is, therefore, subject to disclosure, within three (3) working days after receipt of the response, the director of the department of environmental quality shall inform the person making the confidentiality claim of the determination. The decision shall be a final agency action directly appealable, de novo, to the district court of the county where the records or some part thereof are located. An appeal contesting the decision of the director of the department of environmental quality to release information claimed to be a trade secret shall be filed within ten (10) working days from the date of receipt of the written notice of decision. The information claimed to be a trade secret shall not be disclosed until the period for appeal has expired with no appeal being taken, or a court order has been issued finding that the information is not a trade secret and all appeals of that order have been exhausted.
(7)  In any appeal taken pursuant to this section, the court may award reasonable costs and attorney’s fees to the prevailing party if it finds the claim of confidentiality or the decision of the director of the department of environmental quality to provide records was frivolously pursued.
(8)  The department of environmental quality shall adopt rules which include:
(a)  Appropriate measures to safeguard and protect against improper disclosure of trade secrets, including procedures to train all employees on the proper handling of trade secrets; and
(b)  Any other provisions necessary to carry out this section.
(9)  As it relates to the department of environmental quality, or to agents, contractors, or other representatives of the department, the immunity created in section 74-118, Idaho Code, shall apply only when disclosure of a trade secret is made consistent with this section.",2

An adoption may be dissolved, upon petition, with the agreement of both the adoptee and the adopting parent, when the adopting parent was the spouse of a natural parent, and the marriage of the natural parent and adoptive parent was terminated. If the petition for dissolution occurs after the death of the adoptive parent, the court shall, in the finding of dissolution, specify the effect upon rights of inheritance.

DEVOLUTION OF ESTATE AT DEATH — RESTRICTIONS. The power of a person to leave property by will, and the rights of creditors, devisees, and heirs to his property are subject to the restrictions and limitations contained in this code to facilitate the prompt settlement of estates. Upon the death of a person, his separate property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by his last will, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving lapse, renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of testate estates, or in the absence of testamentary disposition to his heirs, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of intestate estates, and upon the death of a husband or wife, the decedent’s share of their community property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by his last will, or in the absence of testamentary disposition, to the surviving spouse, but all of their community property which is under the management and control of the decedent is subject to his debts and administration, and that portion of their community property which is not under the management and control of the decedent but which is necessary to carry out the provisions of his will is subject to administration; but the devolution of all the above described property is subject to rights to homestead allowance, exempt property, to renunciation to rights of creditors, elective share of the surviving spouse and to administration.",1

REVOCATION BY DIVORCE — NO REVOCATION BY OTHER CHANGES OF CIRCUMSTANCES. If after executing a will the testator is divorced or his marriage annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any disposition or appointment of property made by the will to the former spouse, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse, and any nomination of the former spouse as executor, trustee, conservator, or guardian, unless the will expressly provides otherwise. Property prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment passes as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, and other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the decedent. If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by testator’s remarriage to the former spouse. For purposes of this section, divorce or annulment means any divorce or annulment which would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse within the meaning of subsection (b) of section 15-2-802 of this code. A decree of separation which does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section.

(6)  forty-five (45) days after the death of the decedent, any creditor;
(7)  if a petition for appointment of a personal representative has been filed and sixty (60) days have elapsed during which no consent to act has been filed by any proper person, the public administrator shall act as personal representative unless and until a proper person consents to act.
(b)  An objection to an appointment can be made only in formal proceedings. In case of objection the priorities stated in subsection (a) of this section apply except that
(1)  if the estate appears to be more than adequate to meet exemptions and costs of administration but inadequate to discharge anticipated unsecured claims, the court, on petition of creditors, may appoint any qualified person;
(2)  in case of objection to appointment of a person other than one whose priority is determined by will by an heir or devisee appearing to have a substantial interest in the estate, the court may appoint a person who is acceptable to heirs and devisees whose interests in the estate appear to be worth in total more than half of the probable distributable value, or, in default of this accord any suitable person.
(c)  A person entitled to letters under (2) through (5) of subsection (a) of this section may nominate a qualified person to act as personal representative. Any person aged eighteen (18) and over may renounce his right to an appointment by appropriate writing filed with the court.

(e)  Appointment of one who does not have priority, including priority resulting from renunciation or nomination determined pursuant to this section, may be made only in formal proceedings. Before appointing one without priority, the court must determine that those having priority, although given notice of the proceedings, have failed to request appointment or to nominate another for appointment, and that administration is necessary.
(f)  No person is qualified to serve as a personal representative who is:
(1)  under the age of eighteen (18);
(2)  a person whom the court finds unsuitable in formal proceedings.
(g)  A personal representative appointed by a court of the decedent’s domicile has priority over all other persons except where the decedent’s will nominates different persons to be personal representative in this state and in the state of domicile.
