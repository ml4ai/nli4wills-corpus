PURPOSE, FINDINGS AND LEGISLATIVE INTENT — DEFINITIONS.

The legislature finds that Idaho benefits from a consistent and adequate bandwidth connection to and between its districts and schools, inclusive of grades K through 12, and to its libraries. It is the intent of the legislature that: (a)  State resources be made available to support Idaho’s E-rate eligible entities with technical, E-rate, security, contracting and procurement guidance, and funding distribution; (b)  E-rate eligible entities shall have the ability to collaborate regionally and intrastate for broadband and related services; (c)  Districts shall have the ability to collaborate regionally and intrastate for wireless LAN services; and (d)  E-rate eligible entities apply for and pursue, in good faith, E-rate funding. (2)  As used in this chapter: (a)  ""Districts"" means Idaho public schools grades K through 12, the Idaho digital learning academy, the Idaho department of juvenile corrections’ education programs and the school for the deaf and the blind. (b)  ""E-rate"" means the schools and libraries program of the universal service fund that is administered by the universal service administrative company under the direction of the federal communications commission. (c)  ""E-rate eligible entities"" means Idaho public schools grades K through 12, the Idaho digital learning academy, the Idaho department of juvenile corrections education programs, the school for the deaf and the blind and the Idaho public libraries.",2
A179,"[STATE] FOURTH: I do hereby devise and bequeath to my beloved wife, [Person-2], all and the whole of my estate, both real and personal and of whatsoever kind or character and wheresoever found, to have and hold forever. [COND] The testator did not divorce with his/her spouse until his/her death. The spouse survived the testator. [LAW] 15-3-101.  DEVOLUTION OF ESTATE AT DEATH — RESTRICTIONS. The power of a person to leave property by will, and the rights of creditors, devisees, and heirs to his property are subject to the restrictions and limitations contained in this code to facilitate the prompt settlement of estates. Upon the death of a person, his separate property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by his last will, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving lapse, renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of testate estates, or in the absence of testamentary disposition to his heirs, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of intestate estates, and upon the death of a husband or wife, the decedent’s share of their community property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by his last will, or in the absence of testamentary disposition, to the surviving spouse, but all of their community property which is under the management and control of the decedent is subject to his debts and administration, and that portion of their community property which is not under the management and control of the decedent but which is necessary to carry out the provisions of his will is subject to administration; but the devolution of all the above described property is subject to rights to homestead allowance, exempt property, to renunciation to rights of creditors, elective share of the surviving spouse and to administration.",1
A179,"[STATE] FOURTH: I do hereby devise and bequeath to my beloved wife, [Person-2], all and the whole of my estate, both real and personal and of whatsoever kind or character and wheresoever found, to have and hold forever. [COND] The testator divorced with his/her spouse after he/she executed this will. [LAW] 15-2-508.  REVOCATION BY DIVORCE — NO REVOCATION BY OTHER CHANGES OF CIRCUMSTANCES. If after executing a will the testator is divorced or his marriage annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any disposition or appointment of property made by the will to the former spouse, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse, and any nomination of the former spouse as executor, trustee, conservator, or guardian, unless the will expressly provides otherwise. Property prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment passes as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, and other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the decedent. If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by testator’s remarriage to the former spouse. For purposes of this section, divorce or annulment means any divorce or annulment which would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse within the meaning of subsection (b) of section 15-2-802 of this code. A decree of separation which does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section. No change of circumstances other than as described in this section revokes a will.",0

(a) After commencement of any civil action based upon a claim for relief arising in tort, from property damage, personal injury or wrongful death, any claimant may at any time, no later than ten (10) days before the trial, serve upon an adverse party, a written offer of settlement, offering to settle his claim in such action and to stipulate to a judgment for a sum certain, including any attorney fees allowable by law and costs of litigation then accrued. (b)  If the adverse party, at any time after service of such offer of settlement and prior to its revocation, serves written notice that the offer is accepted, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance, together with proof of service thereof, and thereupon judgment shall be entered for the amount of the offer. In the event that an offer of settlement is revoked by a claimant or not accepted, evidence of the offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs or to award interest pursuant to this section. (c)  If such offer of settlement is not accepted prior to trial pursuant to subsection (b) above, and the action reaches a final judgment by the court after trial, the court shall inquire as to whether any prevailing claimant made an offer of settlement, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, which an adverse party failed to accept. If the court finds that such claimant has recovered an amount equal to or greater than his offer of settlement, the court shall add to the judgment, annual interest on the amount contained in such offer, computed from the date that",2

[LAW] 15-2-508.  REVOCATION BY DIVORCE — NO REVOCATION BY OTHER CHANGES OF CIRCUMSTANCES. If after executing a will the testator is divorced or his marriage annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any disposition or appointment of property made by the will to the former spouse, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse, and any nomination of the former spouse as executor, trustee, conservator, or guardian, unless the will expressly provides otherwise. Property prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment passes as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, and other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the decedent. If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by testator’s remarriage to the former spouse. For purposes of this section, divorce or annulment means any divorce or annulment which would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse within the meaning of subsection (b) of section 15-2-802 of this code.

The power of a person to leave property by will, and the rights of creditors, devisees, and heirs to his property are subject to the restrictions and limitations contained in this code to facilitate the prompt settlement of estates. Upon the death of a person, his separate property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by his last will, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving lapse, renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of testate estates, or in the absence of testamentary disposition to his heirs, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of intestate estates, and upon the death of a husband or wife, the decedent’s share of their community property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by his last will, or in the absence of testamentary disposition, to the surviving spouse, but all of their community property which is under the management and control of the decedent is subject to his debts and administration, and that portion of their community property which is not under the management and control of the decedent but which is necessary to carry out the provisions of his will is subject to administration; but the devolution of all the above described property is subject to rights to homestead allowance, exempt property, to renunciation to rights of creditors, elective share of the surviving spouse and to administration.",1

If after executing a will the testator is divorced or his marriage annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any disposition or appointment of property made by the will to the former spouse, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse, and any nomination of the former spouse as executor, trustee, conservator, or guardian, unless the will expressly provides otherwise. Property prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment passes as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, and other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the decedent. If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by testator’s remarriage to the former spouse. For purposes of this section, divorce or annulment means any divorce or annulment which would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse within the meaning of subsection (b) of section 15-2-802 of this code. A decree of separation which does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section.
