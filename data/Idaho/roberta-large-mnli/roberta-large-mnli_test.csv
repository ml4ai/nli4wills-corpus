G9,"[STATE] THIRD: It is my intention to make a separate written instrument, leaving items of tangible personal property to various people, as allowed by §15-2-513 of the Idaho Code. If I leave no such separate written instrument, then said property shall pass as it would under my Will without such instrument. [COND] The separate written instrument was in the testator's handwriting and described the items and devisees with reasonable certainty. [LAW] § 52-416. Immunity The provisions of any criminal statutes with respect to the exhibition of, or the possession with the intent to exhibit, any obscene film shall not apply to a motion picture projectionist, usher, or ticket taker acting within the scope of his employment, provided that such projectionist, usher, or ticket taker: (1) has no financial interest in the place wherein he is so employed, and (2) freely and willingly gives testimony regarding such employment in any judicial proceedings brought under this chapter, including pre-trial discovery proceedings incident thereto, when and if such is requested, and upon being granted immunity by the trial judge sitting in such matters.",2
G17,"[STATE] FIRST: I declare that my estate whereof I may die possessed is community property of my spouse, [Person-2], and myself. [COND] [Person-1] and [Person-2] remained married after the will was signed and witnessed [LAW] § 15-2-508. Revocation by divorce--No revocation by other changes of circumstances If after executing a will the testator is divorced or his marriage annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any disposition or appointment of property made by the will to the former spouse, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse, and any nomination of the former spouse as executor, trustee, conservator, or guardian, unless the will expressly provides otherwise. Property prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment passes as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, and other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the decedent. If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by testator's remarriage to the former spouse. For purposes of this section, divorce or annulment means any divorce or annulment which would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse within the meaning of subsection (b) of section 15-2-802 of this code. A decree of separation which does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section. No change of circumstances other than as described in this section revokes a will.",1
